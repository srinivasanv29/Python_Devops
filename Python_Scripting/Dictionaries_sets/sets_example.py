# You need to have Unique value inside sets; you cannot have the value repeated 
# inside sets

# [] - list
# () - tuple
# {} - sets 
# sets concept we don't use a lot as a devops engineer

# ("srini", "raj", "ram", "srini") --> This will not be possible as it has 
# repeatation of dataset "srini"

# sets will be used in mathematical kind of operations
