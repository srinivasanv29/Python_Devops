why we need dictionaire in python]
- when we want to store name of a student in python

name = "srini"

ec2_instance = "instance"
student_list = [ "Andy", "Sarvan", "Alex", "Ansari" ]

Dictionary means property of a student

name: " "
id: " "
class: " "
age: ""


{
    name:""
    age:""
    id:""
    class:""
}

What if you have 100 properties ; so we have use above curly braces method to store it as a key value pair.
